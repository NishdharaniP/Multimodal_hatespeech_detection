# Multimodal_hatespeech_detection
Hate speech detection in multilingual settings
presents significant challenges due to linguistic variations and speech patterns across different languages. This study proposes a fusionbased approach that integrates audio and text
features to enhance classification accuracy in
Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam

In conclusion, the hate speech recognition system for Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam showed
promising results by integrating preprocessing techniques for both audio and text. The Random Forest model effectively captured semantic features
for text, achieving high accuracy, while the CNN
model extracted key features from audio signals,
also yielding high accuracy. The fusion of these
models enhanced performance, enabling more accurate and context-aware predictions by utilizing
both modalities.
